# Lawyer-Case-Recommendation-System
• The judicial system in India is one of the most laborious 
institutions in the world thanks in part to the large population 
and the attention to detail every case requires.<br>
• One of the ways to support the system is the ability to 
streamline the references of a case to previous cases<br>
• Our goal is to build a recommendation system that can suggest past cases that 
are similar to a prompt that is given or based on another case.<br>
